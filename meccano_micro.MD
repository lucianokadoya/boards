## Meccano Micro
Meccano Micro is a development kit based on ESP8266, integates GPIO, PWM, IIC, 1-Wire and ADC all in one board.
Different from other ESP8266 projects, Meccano board has been heavily tested in retail stores and adjusted to be safe against RF (radio frequency) interferences. The physical store is an inhospitable environment since there are several hundreds of electronic products, such as TVs, computers, sound and home theaters as well as electronic home appliances.
